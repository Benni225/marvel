Welcome to Marvel!
******************
Marvel wants to be an easy, simple to use PHP-Framework using the MVC-paradigma.
It wants to support you with an easy syntax.

Example:
Application::create();
Router::create()->route();
Router::get()->controller();
Router::get()->action();

The URL-structure is for every app:
http:://www.server.com/controller/action/parameter1/value1/parameter2/value2/
The last "/" is important. If it's missing, the application can't routed at moment.

In the moment Marvel is in a pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha-phase. Become a part of Marvel.

Support us, so we can support you.
