Welcome to Marvel!
******************
Marvel wants to be an easy, simple to use PHP-Framework using the MVC-paradigma.
It wants to support you with an easy syntax.

Example:
<code>
Application::create();
Router::create()->route();
Router::get()->controller();
Router::get()->action();
</code>

The URL-structure is for every app:
http:://www.server.com/controller/action/parameter1/value1/parameter2/value2

If you want to use an url-alias you can do it like this:
Write into the file 'boot.php' of your app:
<code>
Router::addAlias('start', array('yourController', 'yourAction'));
</code>

Now
http://www.server.com/start/p1/v1/p2/v2
is the same like
http://www.server.com/yourController/yourAction/p1/v1/p2/v2


In the moment Marvel is in a pre-pre-pre-pre-alpha-phase. Become a part of Marvel.
